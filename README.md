Description
-----------
The ResetOpCache plugin for Moodle enables administrators to reset PHP's OpCache from within Moodle. This can be useful when making changes to PHP code on an existing Moodle site where you don't have any other way of resetting an existing opcache.

This will also reset Moodle's own cache at the same time.

Requirements
------------
This plugin requires Moodle 2.5+ from http://moodle.org .

-------
The initial public BETA version was released on 2016-12-19.

For information on releases since then, see CHANGELOG.md.
